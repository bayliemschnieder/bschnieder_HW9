1. Description of the project
This project is about a survey sent to Business Analytics Student’s. They are asked 6 questions and prompted to answer most of them. This was all made using HTML and CSS.

2. How your web form conforms to best practices for forms.
My web form uses html 5, and I made sure the background was good for colorblind people. I added required sections. These sections help so people don’t skip over the sections that need required answers. I also formed this to be easy to understand and see. Using the bootstrap it helps more the format overall more accessible. 

I gave multiple choices for responses on questions, for example I have a multiple choice question, a multiple select question. These help end users make better choices. The questions that you type in are more personal and not hard to answer. Having a dropdown menu also helps in answering questions effectively. The navigation between pages is also very nice. 

3. How your form provides for user accessibility.
There was a toggle provided to help if there is any confusion when answering the question. The color contrast being black and white is good for the general guideline. The way the button is formatted too, make it so the person cannot more forward to next page without answering. The footer at the end helps the user check track.
